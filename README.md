coursework
----------
- `./start-cvrp` to build and run, `fruitybun250.vrp` has to be in the same directory, `cvrp-info.txt` as the note for the marker 
- `G++ 4.8.5` or later version needed for compilation   
- `OpenMP` parallel running enabled
- `chrono` high resolution timing is commented out
- `best-solution.txt` best solution so far
- `java -jar validater.jar` to verify the correctness of the solution in `best-solution.txt`
- `mono plot-route.exe` to plot the best solution in `best-solution.txt`; `Mono` needed
